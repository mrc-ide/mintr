<p><strong>Impact</strong> shows the estimated prevalence in the zone over time and the average clinical cases averted
    per person per year across the 3 years since implementing an intervention package. </p> <strong>Graphs</strong> <p>
    The first figure shows how prevalence is predicted to change given an intervention package introduced at year
    0.
</p> Lines show either:
<ul>
    <li>a 'do-nothing' scenario where interventions are not replaced (grey)</li>
    <li>continuation of Pyrethroid ITNs (blue)</li>
    <li>a switch to Pyrethroid-PBO ITNs (green)</li>
    <li>a switch to IRS only at a user-defined coverage (purple)</li>
    <li>continuation with Pyrethroid ITNs plus additional IRS at a coverage determined by the user (darkred)</li>
    <li>or a switch to Pyrethroid-PBO ITNs plus additional IRS at a coverage determined by the user (orange)</li>
</ul> <p> In the second figure, the bars indicate the same intervention packages as above relative to the 'do-nothing'
    scenario. </p> <p> The impact figures present the best achievable option for the zones without consideration of
    cost. The impact table presents the estimated numbers for these estimates. Please note that these are not
    necessarily accurate but the degree of change should provide intuitive insight into the potential of each impact
    package and the direction of change is reflective of reality according to model checks and validations (a review
    paper is in preparation). </p> <strong>Table</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Interventions: The ITN and IRS combination used for the scenario.</li>
    <li>Net use (%): The percentage of people using a ITN the previous night.</li>
    <li>IRS cover (%): The percentage of people sleeping in an IRS protected home.</li>
    <li> Prevalence under 5 yrs: Yr 1 post intervention: The prevalence in children under 5 years old 1 year after the
        intervention package is implemented.
    </li>
    <li> Prevalence under 5 yrs: Yr 2 post intervention: The prevalence in children under 5 years old 2 year after the
        intervention package is implemented.
    </li>
    <li> Prevalence under 5 yrs: Yr 3 post intervention: The prevalence in children under 5 years old 3 year after the
        intervention package is implemented.
    </li>
    <li> Relative reduction in prevalence in under 5 yrs (%): The relative efficacy of the investigated intervention
        package against the 'do-nothing' scenario at 3-years post switching to the alternative interventions.
    </li>
    <li> Cases averted (all-age) across 3-yrs since intervention: The absolute number of clinical cases averted given
        the population size inputed and relative to the 'do-nothing' scenario.
    </li>
    <li> Mean cases averted (all-age) per 1,000 people per year (across 3-yrs since intervention): The mean number of
        clinical cases averted annually per 1,000 people per year given the population size inputed and relative to the
        'do-nothing' scenario.
    </li>
    <li> Relative reduction in clinical cases (across 3-yrs since intervention) (%): The percentage-efficacy of the
        investigated intervention package against clinical cases relative to the 'do-nothing' scenario.
    </li>
    <li> Mean cases per person per year (averaged across 3-yrs since intervention): The predicted number of clinical
        cases per person.
