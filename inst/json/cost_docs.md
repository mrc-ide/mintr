**Cost Effectiveness** shows the estimated cost per intervention package against the expected efficacy.

**Graphs**

The first figure shows costs per 1,000 people and cases averted per 1,000 people following a 3-year intervention package introduced at year 0.

The absolute costs are predicted and shown for each intervention package. The summary information provided by the user is shown to indicate the ITN usage expected in
the zone and the expected IRS coverage to be achieved in the zone.

In the second figure the bars indicate the cost in USD per case averted relative to the 'no intervention' scenario.

**Table**

The cost effectiveness table provides the numeric estimates projected by the model. Please note that these are not 
necessarily accurate but the degree of change should provide intuitive insight into the potential of each impact package 
and the direction of change is reflective of reality according to model checks and validations (in preparation).

*   Interventions: The ITN and IRS combination used for the scenario.
*   Net use (%): The percentage of people using a ITN the previous night.
*   IRS cover (%): The percentage of people sleeping in an IRS protected home.
*   Total cases averted: Total number of clinical cases averted in the population over 3 years, relative to the 'no intervention' scenario
*   Total costs (USD): The total cost in USD expected for the product procurement and implementation for the
 intervention package to cover a 3-year period of protection.
*   Cost per case averted across 3 years: The cost in USD per case averted per 3-year campaign relative to the
'do-nothing' scenario.

You can hover the cursor above a value in the graph or table to observe the uncertainty. Here uncertainty is restricted to effects from ITN or IRS interventions.

*IRS refers to a long-lasting non-pyrethroid IRS product (impact reflects recent Actellic 300CS and SumiShield products).*
