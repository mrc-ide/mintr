**Cost Effectiveness** shows the estimated cost per intervention package against the expected efficacy.

**Graphs**

The first figure shows total costs and cases averted following a 3-year intervention package introduced at year 0.

The red dashed line is showing the maximum zonal budget determined by the user for the zone. 
If no red line is show the y-axis scale does not intercept this value. The absolute costs are predicted and shown for
each intervention package. The summary information provided by the user is shown to indicate the ITN usage expected in
the zone and the expected IRS coverage to be achieved in the zone.

In the second figure the bars indicate the cost in USD per case averted relative to the 'do-nothing' scenario.

**Table**

The cost effectiveness table provides the numeric estimates projected by the model. Please note that these are not 
necessarily accurate but the degree of change should provide intuitive insight into the potential of each impact package 
and the direction of change is reflective of reality according to model checks and validations (in preparation).

*   Interventions: The ITN and IRS combination used for the scenario.
*   Net use (%): The percentage of people using a ITN the previous night.
*   IRS cover (%): The percentage of people sleeping in an IRS protected home.
*   Mean cases averted per 1,000 people per year (averaged across 3-yrs since intervention): The predicted number of 
clinical cases per 1,000 people averted by the intervention package relaive to the continuation of the 'do-nothing' scenario.
*   Total costs ($USD): The total cost in USD expected for the product procurement and implementation for the
 intervention package to cover a 3-year period of protection.
*   Incremental increase in costs: The absolute increase in cost (USD) required for the intervention package relative 
to the cost spent to achieve the 'do-nothing' scenario.
*   Cost per case averted per 3-year campaign: The cost in USD per case averted relative to the 'do-nothing' scenario.
