<p><strong>Cost Effectiveness</strong> shows the estimated cost per intervention package against the expected efficacy.
</p>
<strong>Graphs</strong>
<p>
    The red dashed line is showing the maximum zonal budget determined by the user for the zone. If no red line is show
    the y-axis scale does not intercept this value. The absolute costs are predicted and shown for each intervention
    package. The summary information provided by the user is shown to indicate the ITN usage expected in the zone and
    the expected IRS coverage to be achieved in the zone.
</p>
<strong>Table</strong>
<p>
    The cost effectiveness table provides the numeric estimates projected by the model. Please note that these are not
    necessarily accurate but the degree of change should provide intuitive insight into the potential of each impact
    package and the direction of change is reflective of reality according to model checks and validations (in
    preparation).

<ul>
    <li>Interventions: The ITN and IRS combination used for the scenario.</li>
    <li>Net use (%): The percentage of people using a ITN the previous night.</li>
    <li>IRS cover (%): The percentage of people sleeping in an IRS protected home.</li>
    <li>Mean cases averted per 1,000 people per year (averaged across 3-yrs since intervention): The predicted number of
        clinical cases per 1,000 people averted by the intervention package relaive to the continuation of the
        'do-nothing'
        scenario.
    </li>
    <li>Total costs ($USD): The total cost in USD expected for the product procurement and implementation for the
        intervention
        package to cover a 3-year period of protection.
    </li>
    <li>Incremental increase in costs: The absolute increase in cost (USD) required for the intervention package
        relative
        to
        the cost spent to achieve the 'do-nothing' scenario.
    </li>
    <li>MCost per case averted: The cost in USD per case averted relative to the 'do-nothing' scenario.</li>
