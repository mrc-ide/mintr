**Impact** shows the estimated prevalence in the zone over time and the average clinical cases averted per person per 
year across the 3 years since implementing an intervention package.

**Graphs**

The first figure shows how prevalence is predicted to change given an intervention package introduced at year 0.

Lines show either:

*   a 'do-nothing' scenario where interventions are not replaced (grey)
*   continuation of Pyrethroid ITNs (blue)
*   a switch to Pyrethroid-PBO ITNs (green)
*   a switch to IRS only at a user-defined coverage (purple)
*   continuation with Pyrethroid ITNs plus additional IRS at a coverage determined by the user (darkred)
*   or a switch to Pyrethroid-PBO ITNs plus additional IRS at a coverage determined by the user (orange)

In the second figure, the bars indicate the same intervention packages as above relative to the 'do-nothing' scenario.

The impact figures present the best achievable option for the zones without consideration of cost. The impact table
 presents the estimated numbers for these estimates. Please note that these are not necessarily accurate but the degree
  of change should provide intuitive insight into the potential of each impact package and the direction of change is 
  reflective of reality according to model checks and validations (a review paper is in preparation).

**Table**

*   Interventions: The ITN and IRS combination used for the scenario.
*   Net use (%): The percentage of people using a ITN the previous night.
*   IRS cover (%): The percentage of people sleeping in an IRS protected home.
*   Prevalence under 10 years: Year 1 post intervention: The prevalence in children under 5 years old 1 year after the intervention package is implemented.
*   Prevalence under 10 years: Year 2 post intervention: The prevalence in children under 5 years old 2 year after the intervention package is implemented.
*   Prevalence under 10 years: Year 3 post intervention: The prevalence in children under 5 years old 3 year after the intervention package is implemented.
*   Relative reduction in prevalence in under 10 years (%): The relative efficacy of the investigated intervention package against the 'do-nothing' scenario at 3-years post switching to the alternative interventions.
*   Mean cases averted per population per year across 3 years since intervention: The absolute number of clinical cases averted given the population size inputed and relative to the 'do-nothing' scenario.
*   Mean cases averted per 1,000 people per year across 3 years since intervention: The mean number of clinical cases averted annually per 1,000 people per year given the population size inputed and relative to the 'do-nothing' scenario.
*   Relative reduction in clinical cases across 3 years since intervention (%): The percentage-efficacy of the investigated intervention package against clinical cases relative to the 'do-nothing' scenario.
*   Mean cases per person per year across 3 years: The predicted number of clinical cases per person, averaged across 3 years since intervention.
